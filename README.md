## How it works :hammer_and_wrench:

When a request is made by the client it passes through the extension that redirects the sites in the blacklist to a non-existent one which, therefore, responds with an error, and the advertisement cannot load.

In this way, the sites fail to recognize this as an ad-blocker but simply as a site error.

## Install the preview :file_folder:

Installing the preview is quite easy.

1. Download the source code and extract the folder
2. Go on your Chromium browser and open extensions settings as
    - `brave://extensions/`
    - `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable developer mode
4. Click on Load Unpacked and select your Unzip folder
5. Now the extension is loaded.

## Blocked sites :no_entry:
